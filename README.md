- **SIMPLE DATA TYPES**

1. Simple Data Types | Store a name and assign a variable a value containing the characters of your first name. ✓

2. Print he value and the data type of the variable declared above. ✓

```csharp
# The output must be in the following format:

name: {display value} type: {display data type} ✓
```

4. Print the value and the datatype of the variable declared above. ✓

```csharp
# The output must be in the following format:

has license: {display value} type: {display data type} ✓
```

- **PERFORM MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS**

1. Declare a variable to store a the current Canadian Federal Goods and Services Tax Rate (GST). Since the GST does not change frequently, this would be a good situation in which to identify this variable using constant notation. Ensure this variable is defined as a constant. Assign this variable the actual value of current Canadian Federal Goods and Services Tax Rate. ✓

2. Declare a variable to store a the current Manitoba Provincial Sales Tax Rate (PST). Since the PST does not change frequently, this would be a good situation in which to identify this variable using constant notation. Ensure this variable is defined as a constant. Assign this variable the actual value of current Manitoba Provincial Sales Tax Rate. ✓

3. Declare a variable to store the purchase price of a vehicle and assign it a value of your choosing between 60000.01 and 100000.00. ✓

4. Using the variables and constants described in the previous steps, calculate the Federal and Provincial Tax that would be charged for sale of the vehicle (step 3). The two tax values will be stored in two separate variables. ✓

5. Calculate the final cost of the vehicle. The final cost of the vehicle is the sum of the purchase price and taxes. The final cost of the vehicle will be stored in a variable. ✓

6. Print the results of the calculations using a single print statement without formatting (do not use any f-strings). The output must be in the following format (use actual values in place of {value}): ✓

7. Print again using f-strings where the numeric data is formatted. Format the numeric data to two decimal places and commas as the thousand separator. Also, precede the formatted numeric value with a dollar sign ($). Example: $1,234.50 ✓

```csharp
# The output must be in the following format (use formatted values in place of {formatted value}):
Purchase Price: ${formatted value} Provincial Tax: ${formatted value} Federal Tax: ${formatted value} Total: ${formatted value} ✓
```

```csharp
# Save and Commit!
# Save and commit your changes with a meaningful message. ✓
```

- **DECLARE AND USE COLLECTION TYPES**

1. Declare a variable that stores a list. Assign the variable a new list containing the literal values 1 through 10 inclusive. ✓

2. Verify a list has been created by printing the data type of your variable. ✓

3. Print the list. ✓

4. Add your first name to the list created in step 1 between the elements containing the values of 5 and 6. Do not redefine the list. ✓

5. Print the list. ✓

6. Remove the number 9 from the list created in step 1. ✓

7. Print the list.

8. Declare a variable that stores a list. Assign the variable a new list containing the literal values representing the characters A, B and C. This new list must have three elements, where each element represent a single character. ✓

9. Declare a variable that stores a list. Assign the variable a new list containing values of the first and second lists created above. You must not use literal values to accomplish this task. The new list must not contain any lists. ✓

10. Print the list created in step 9. ✓

```csharp
# Save and Commit!
# Save and commit your changes with a meaningful message. ✓
```

- **TUPLES**

1. Declare a variable that stores a tuple. Assign the variable a new tuple that contains names of 4 Canadian provinces.

2. Verify a tuple has been created by printing the data type of your tuple.

3. Print the tuple.

4. Save and Commit your changes with a meaningful message.

- **DICTIONARIES**

1. Declare a variable to store a dictionary. Assign the variable a dictionary that has the keys 'nickel', 'dime', and 'quarter' with the corresponding Canadian currency amounts as the values (as floating points) (e.g. nickel is associated with the value 0.05).

2. Verify a dictionary has been created by printing the data type of your dictionary.

3. Print the dictionary.

4. Modify the values of each of the items in the dictionary to use whole numbers. (e.g. nickel is associated with the value 5).

5. Print the dictionary.

6. Add two items to the existing dictionary representing the Loonie and Toonie (Loonie = 100, Toonie = 200).

7. Print the dictionary.

8. Save and commit your changes with a meaningful message.

- **SETS**

1. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set containing literal values representing even numbers values between 2 and 20 (inclusive).

2. Verify a set has been created by printing the data type of your set.

3. Print the set.

4. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set containing the literal values representing multiples of 5 between 5 and 20 (inclusive).

5. Print the set.

6. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set which contains only the unique values of the two sets created above. Do not use literal values to accomplish this task.

7. Print the set.

8. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set which contains only the values that the first two sets have in common. Do not use literal values to accomplish this task.

9. Print the set.

10. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set which contains only the values that appear in the first set (multiples of 2) but not in the second set (multiples of 5). Do not use literal values to accomplish this task.

11. Print the set.

12. Declare a variable to store a set. Assign the variable a new set which contains only the values that appear in the second set (multiples of 5) but not in the first set (multiples of 2). You must not use literal values to accomplish this task.
